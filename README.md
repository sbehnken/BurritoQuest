# BurritoQuest

When launched Burrito Quest uses Google Places Api to automatically find burrito restaurants near the users current location. No need to type in anything. Huzzah!

Burrito restaurant name, address, price and user rating are displayed in individual card views.

Clicking on the forward arrow button brings up the location of that burrito restaurant with name and address on a Google marker info window. 

You can get directions to your chosen burrito place by clicking on the marker which pulls up the Google button arrow button in the bottom right corner. 

The GPS button in the top right corner brings the camera view back to your current location.
